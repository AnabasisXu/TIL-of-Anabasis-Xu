For me, the GitHub interface is more intuitive: 1 Fork the original-repo to my-repo 2 Go to the pull request section of the original-repo, and click one of the pull requests 3 Create a pull request by comparing the pull-request-repo and my-repo 4 Merge the pull request you created in my-repo 5 Repeat steps 2-4 for all the pull-request-repos
