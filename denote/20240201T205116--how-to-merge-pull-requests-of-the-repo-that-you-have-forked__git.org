There are two ways to do it: the github interface and the command line.

For me, the github interface is more intuitive:
1 Fork the original-repo to my-repo
2 Go to the pull request section of the original-repo, and click one of the pull requests
3 Create pull request by comparing the pull-request-repo and my-repo
4 Merge the pull request you created in my-repo
5 Repeat step 2-4 for all the pull-request-repos
