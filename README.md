## About me

This is Anabasis Xu, and I am a technical writer and translator.

I like both Emacs and Vim, and I use Vim from within Emacs with Evil mode, and Emacs within VScode with [VSpaceCode](https://github.com/VSpaceCode/VSpaceCode).

In this repo, I will update things that I learned on my translation and technical writing journey.
