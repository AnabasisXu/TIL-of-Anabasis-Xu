## About me
This is Anabasis Xu, and I am a technical writer and translator. 

I like both Emacs and Vim, but choose to use Vim from within Emacs.

In this repo, I will update things that I learned on my translation and technical writing journey.

I thought about having a blog, but for now, it seems that a TIL repo like this is quite enough.

A good translation for "TIL" may be "日知录".
