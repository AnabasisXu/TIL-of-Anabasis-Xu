## About me

This is Anabasis Xu, a technical writer and translator currently learning Web Development.

I like both Emacs and Vim, but I use Vim from within Emacs with [Evil Mode](https://github.com/emacs-evil/evil), and Emacs within Visual Studio Code with [VSpaceCode](https://github.com/VSpaceCode/VSpaceCode). My impression is that Emacs provides a superior editing experience, but Visual Studio Code is easier to set up.  

In this repository, I will update things that I learned along my translation and technical writing journey, in the hope that others of similar backgrounds might find them useful.
