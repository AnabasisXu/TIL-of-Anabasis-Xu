## About me

This is Anabasis Xu, a technical writer and translator currently learning Web Development.

I like both Emacs and Vim, but I use Vim from within Emacs with [Evil Mode](https://github.com/emacs-evil/evil), and Emacs within VSCode with [VSpaceCode](https://github.com/VSpaceCode/VSpaceCode). My impression is that Emacs provides a superior editing experience, but VSCode is easier to set up.  

In this repo, I will update things that I learned along my translation and technical writing journey, in the hope that others of similar backgrounds may find them useful.
