* Quick Comparison of GUI and Termux Emacs on Android
I have been exploring the possiblity of using Emacs on my phone to make better use of my time on the metro. So far there is long way to perfection.
** What does not work on Termux Emacs
*** UI
**** Posframe not working

**** C-Prior&C-Next

*** Org
**** org capture protocol

**** C-ret not working, as it is mapped to open org link
** What does not work on GUI Emacs
*** touch to display screen keyboard
What a pity! For now I just have to use it with a physical keyboard.
Even if the screen keyboard works, I still have to switch from English and CJK input. So perhaps the only right way to use Emacs on android is to use it with a physical keyboard.
** What does not work on both
*** cannot run org code blocks
