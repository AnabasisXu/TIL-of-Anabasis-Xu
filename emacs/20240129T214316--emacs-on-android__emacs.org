* Quick Comparison between GUI and Termux Emacs on Android
I have been exploring the possibility of using Emacs on my phone to make better use of my time on the metro. Emacs on Android has a long way to go. I have read the article [[https://lwn.net/Articles/936576/][Emacs for Android [LWN.net]]], in which the current maintainer of Emacs showed reluctancy towards merging the Android code. 
In the following, I mark a few observations of what works and what does not work on Android. My greatest surprise is that the org-capture protocol works. I use the Kiwi browser with Surfingkeys. Howeverï¼Œ it only works with a physical keyboard.

** What does not work on Termux Emacs
*** UI
**** Posframe
**** The keybinding of C-Prior and C-Next, which I bind to (centaur-tabs-forward) and (centaur-tabs-backward).

*** Org
**** org-capture protocol
**** C-ret not working, as it is mapped to the "open org link".
** What does not work on GUI Emacs
*** Touch to display screen keyboard
For now, I have to use it with a physical keyboard.
Even if the screen keyboard works, I still have to switch from English and CJK input. So perhaps the only right way to use Emacs on Android is to use it with a physical keyboard.
** What does not work on both
*** org code blocks
